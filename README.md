Team Tru-Ruak of the hackathon. 

The world is definitely leaning towards technology. Being a tech enthusiast is the only way to catch up with that. On the other hand, programming languages are the only way of communicating with them. As the demand for learning to code is rising, the learning resources are also enhancing. But that's where the problem arises. And when it comes to teaching a middle schooler how to code, the internet gets blind. 

Therefore, we developed this application to attract the kids towards learning. Because it is written in easy language and full of interactive exercises and games, the students will start learning with the IPO cycle. Then eventually, they will have learned variables, operators, arrays, loops, and constants. In every step, there will be games, and the scores will be saved. Students can only go to the next topic once they get the mark to clear that step. To make this more attractive, we have added some projects for them (Calculator,  Snake game, tic tac toe). If they go through each topic, they will be able to complete them even if they get hints in between to complete the project.
